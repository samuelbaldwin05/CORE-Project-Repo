## Our Problem 

Getting a co-op is one of every Northeastern student's most tim-consuming and energy-intensive tasks. Our platform CORE (co-op rating and evaluation) assists students in making informed co-op search decisions
through providing detailed statistics and insights from previous applicants and students who have completed their internships. With the new limit of only one hundred applications, each student must be even more selective
with their search, and CORE can provide all of the necessary tools students need to accomplish their co-opsearch goals.

## Our Application

Our application is primarily for students seeking co-op opportunities. With features such as filters for acceptance rates and application requirements paired with a dashboard of detailed application, interview, and acceptance statistics, CORE can vastly increase the effectiveness of any student's search. Co-op advisors are also able to benefit from this. Using the data we collect, guiding students to co-ops that are more tailored to them and their goals can become a breeze. With COREâ€™s capabilities we can streamline the process of searching and applying for co-ops and allow students to focus their time and energy where it matters most.
